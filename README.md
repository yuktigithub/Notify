# Notify
This project is helpful for users who want to keep track of price changes for specific products and be notified through email when they become more affordable.
Technologies used - Python, flask, BeautifulSoup, HTML and css.

Notify is our web app that is based on web scraping through Beautiful Soup which is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
We have used python, beautiful soup, flask, html and CSS.

#If it shows such error while running html file: 
##Refused to apply style from <URL> because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled angular

solution: Add <base href="/">  in head before linking all css files
